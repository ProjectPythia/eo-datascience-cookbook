Besides EODC‚Äôs, other catalogues can be found on \n\nSTAC Index, such as United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat imagery, Sentinel Hub, Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem, and so on. Briefly spoken, STAC can be used to search, discover, and access metadata of these datasets with the same code. The EODC Catalogue can be accessed on the web via this \n\nlink as well.\n\nEach STAC catalog, composed by different providers, has many collections. To get all collections of a catalog, we can print all of them and their ids, which are used to fetch them from the catalog.\n\ncollections = eodc_catalog.get_collections()\n\n# length of string of collection.id, for pretty print\nmax_length = max(len(collection.id) for collection in collections)\n\nfor collection in eodc_catalog.get_collections():\n    print(f\"{collection.id.ljust(max_length)}: {collection.title}\")\n\nTo get a specific collection from the catalog, we can use the client.get_collection() method and provide the collection name. We can then display its description, id, temporal and spatial extent, license, etc. In this notebook, we will work with the Sentinel-1 sigma naught 20m collection.\n\ncolllection_id = \"SENTINEL1_SIG0_20M\"\n\ncollection = eodc_catalog.get_collection(colllection_id)\ncollection\n\nEach collection has multiple items. An item is one spatio-temporal instance in the collection, for instance a satellite image. If items are needed for a specific timeframe or for a specific region of interest, we can define this as a query.\n\ntime_range = \"2022-10-01/2022-10-07\"  # a closed range\n# time_range = \"2022-01\"  # whole month, same can be done for a year and a day\n# time_range = \"2022-01-01/..\"  # up to the current date, an open range\n# time_range = \"2022-01-01T05:34:46\"  # a specific time instance\n\nA spatial region of interest can be defined in different ways. One option is to define a simple bounding box:\n\nlatmin, latmax = 46.3, 49.3  # South to North\nlonmin, lonmax = 13.8, 17.8  # West to East\n\nbounding_box = [lonmin, latmin, lonmax, latmax]\n\nIf the region of interest is not rectangular, we can also define a polygon:\n\n# GEOJSON can be created on geojson.io\n\n# This specific area of interest is a rectangle, but since it is\n# a closed polygon it seems like it has five nodes\n\narea_of_interest = {\n    \"coordinates\": [\n        [\n            [17.710928010825853, 49.257630084442496],\n            [13.881798300915221, 49.257630084442496],\n            [13.881798300915221, 46.34747715326259],\n            [17.710928010825853, 46.34747715326259],\n            [17.710928010825853, 49.257630084442496],\n        ]\n    ],\n    \"type\": \"Polygon\",\n}\n\nUsing our previously loaded STAC catalog, we can now search for items fullfilling our query. In this example we are using the bounding box. If we want to use an area of interest specified in the geojson format - one has to use the intersects parameter as documented in the comment below.\n\nsearch = eodc_catalog.search(\n    collections=colllection_id,  # can also be a list of several collections\n    bbox=bounding_box,  # search by bounding box\n    # intersects=area_of_interest,  # GeoJSON search\n    datetime=time_range,\n    # max_items=1  # number of max items to load\n)\n\n# If we comment everything besides colllection_id, we will load whole\n# collection for available region and time_range\n\nitems_eodc = search.item_collection()\nprint(f\"On EODC we found {len(items_eodc)} items for the given search query\")\n\nNow, we can fetch a single item, in this case a Sentinel-1 image, from the query results. A good practice is to always check what metadata the data provider has stored on the item level. This can be done by looking into the item properties.\n\nitem = items_eodc[0]\nitem.properties\n\nFor now, let‚Äôs display only the vertical-vertical (VV) polarized band of the item and some information about the data.\n\nitem.assets[\"VV\"].extra_fields.get(\"raster:bands\")[0]\n\nIn the EODC STAC catalogue an item can conveniently be displayed using its thumbnail.\n\nitem.assets[\"thumbnail\"].href\n\nNow we will plot the data on a map using the thumbnail and the python package \n\nfolium. This is an easy way to quickly check how the data found by a search query looks on a map.\n\nmap = folium.Map(\n    location=[(latmin + latmax) / 2, (lonmin + lonmax) / 2],\n    zoom_start=7,\n    zoom_control=False,\n    scrollWheelZoom=False,\n    dragging=False,\n)\n\nfolium.GeoJson(area_of_interest, name=\"Area of Interest\").add_to(map)\n\nfor item in items_eodc:\n    # url leading to display of an item, can also be used as hyperlink\n    image_url = item.assets[\"thumbnail\"].href\n    bounds = item.bbox\n    folium.raster_layers.ImageOverlay(\n        image=image_url,\n        bounds=[[bounds[1], bounds[0]], [bounds[3], bounds[2]]],\n    ).add_to(map)\n\nfolium.LayerControl().add_to(map)\n\nmap\n\nFigure 1: Map of study area.

This saves memory, but if one would like to do further analysis, the data has to be loaded into memory or downloaded on disk.\n\nIn the following, we will demonstrate this with the library odc-stac. Here we can define what data will loaded as bands; in this case VV sigma naught. Moreover we can resample the data by providing any coordinate reference system (CRS) and resolution as well as a method for resampling of continuos data (e.g. bilinear resampling). In the example below we use the EQUI7 Grid of Europe and a 20 meter sampling. This is the native format of sigma naught stored at EODC, so there will be no actual resampling. Note, also, that resampling is not advisable for this data, as it is provided on a logarithmic scale. More about this in the notebook ‚ÄúBackscattering Coefficients‚Äù.\n\nThe chunks argument is an advancement method for performing parallel computations on the data. We will not cover this in further detail.\n\nbands = \"VV\"  # Vertical-vertical polarized\ncrs = \"EPSG:27704\"  # Coordinate Reference System: EQUI7 Grid of Europe\nres = 20  # 20 meter\nchunks = {\"time\": 1, \"latitude\": 1000, \"longitude\": 1000}\nsig0_dc = odc_stac.load(\n    items_eodc,\n    bands=bands,\n    crs=crs,\n    resolution=res,\n    bbox=bounding_box,\n    chunks=chunks,\n    resampling=\"bilinear\",\n)\n\nLet‚Äôs have a look at the VV polarized band of the dataset.\n\nsig0_dc.VV\n\nAs we can see, the data is stored as a xarray DataArray. Xarray is a convenient package for multidimensional labeled arrays, like temperature, humidity, pressure, different bands of satellite imagery, and so on. \n\nThe link provides detailed documentation. In a later notebook we will explore some more of the functionality of xarray. As we can see in the coordinates, the data here consists of 21 time steps.\n\nIn general, data from STAC is ‚Äúlazily‚Äù loaded, which means that the structure of the DataArray is constructed, but the data is not loaded yet. It is loaded only at instance when it is needed, for example, for plotting, computations, and so on.\n\nSince the DataArray has currently a size of almost 18 GiB, we will subset it to the region of Vienna.\n\n# Create a bounding box covering the region of Vienna\nlatmin_smaller, latmax_smaller = 48, 48.4\nlonmin_smaller, lonmax_smaller = 16, 16.5\n\nsmaller_bounding_box = [\n    [latmin_smaller, lonmin_smaller],\n    [latmax_smaller, lonmax_smaller],\n]\n\nmap = folium.Map(\n    location=[\n        (latmin_smaller + latmax_smaller) / 2,\n        (lonmin_smaller + lonmax_smaller) / 2,\n    ],\n    zoom_start=8,\n    zoom_control=False,\n    scrollWheelZoom=False,\n    dragging=False,\n)\n\nfolium.GeoJson(area_of_interest, name=\"Area of Interest\").add_to(map)\n\nfolium.Rectangle(\n    bounds=smaller_bounding_box,\n    color=\"red\",\n).add_to(map)\n\nfor item in items_eodc:\n    image_url = item.assets[\"thumbnail\"].href\n    bounds = item.bbox\n    folium.raster_layers.ImageOverlay(\n        image=image_url,\n        bounds=[[bounds[1], bounds[0]], [bounds[3], bounds[2]]],\n    ).add_to(map)\n\nfolium.LayerControl().add_to(map)\n\nmap\n\nFigure 2: Map of study area. Blue rectangle is the area covered by the discovered data. Red rectangle covers the selected data.\n\nCreate a new dataset with the smaller bounding box covering the region of Vienna. We will leave out the arguments for resampling and directly use the native format as defined in the metadata.\n\nsig0_dc = odc_stac.load(\n    items_eodc,\n    bands=bands,\n    bbox=[lonmin_smaller, latmin_smaller, lonmax_smaller, latmax_smaller],\n    chunks=chunks,\n)\n\nDue to the way the data is acquired and stored, some items include ‚Äúno data‚Äù areas. In our case, no data has the value -9999, but this can vary from data provider to data provider. This information can usually be found in the metadata. Furthermore, to save memory, data is often stored as integer (e.g. 25) and not in float (e.g. 2.5) format. For this reason, the backscatter values are often multiplied by a scale factor, in this case factor 10.\n\nAs Sentinel-1 satellites overpasses Austria every few days, only some time steps of the dataset will have physical data. As a final step, we will now decode the data and create a plot of two consecutive Sentinel-1 acquisitions of Vienna.\n\n# Retrieve the scale factor and NoData value from the metadata. raster:bands is\n# a STAC raster extension\nscale = item.assets[\"VV\"].extra_fields.get(\"raster:bands\")[0][\"scale\"]\nnodata = item.assets[\"VV\"].extra_fields.get(\"raster:bands\")[0][\"nodata\"]\n\n# Decode data with the NoData value and the scale factor\nsig0_dc = sig0_dc.where(sig0_dc != nodata) / scale\n\n# We should remove unnecessary dates when there was no data\n# (no satellite overpass)\nsig0_dc = sig0_dc.dropna(dim=\"time\")\n\nsig0_dc.VV.plot(col=\"time\", robust=True, cmap=\"Greys_r\", aspect=1, size=10)\n\nFigure 3: Sentinel-1 microwave backscatter image for two timeslices.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise#data-reading","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Unit Conversion"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-1","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Unit Conversion"},"content":"In this notebook, we are going to have a look at the conversion of units.

The robust argument uses the 2^nd^ and 98^th^ percentiles of the data to compute the color limits to eliminate washing out the plot due to data outliers.\n\nIn the plot above you can see the difference between the two scales. The values in dB are more evenly distributed and are therefore easier to plot. The values in linear scale are more spread out and are therefore harder to interpret.\nThis is why we use the dB scale for plotting/visualization.\n\nWhile the logarithmic scale facilitates visual interpretation, it has implications for mathematical operations. In the following, we‚Äôll have a closer look at this. But first, let‚Äôs see how we can convert between the linear and the logarithmic domains.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-1#comparison-of-the-data-in-db-and-linear-scale","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Unit Conversion","lvl2":"Conversion Formulas"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-1#conversion-formulas","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Unit Conversion","lvl2":"Conversion Formulas"},"content":"The decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit used to express the ratio of two values of a physical quantity, often power or intensity. In the case of SAR data, the backscatter coefficient is often expressed in dB to facilitate visualization.\n\nIn order to convert the data from dB to linear scale, we use the following formula.\nLet D be the original value (dB) and I the converted value (m^2m^{-2}). The conversion of units can be expressed as:D =  10  \\cdot \\log_{10} (I) = 10 \\cdot \\log_{10} (e) \\cdot \\ln (I)\\longrightarrow [dB]\n\nSimilarly, the conversion back to the original unit can be expressed as:I = e^{\\frac{D}{10\\cdot \\log_{10}(e)}} = 10^{\\frac{D}{10}} \\longrightarrow [m^2m^{-2}]\n\nYou can find these formulas in the script for Microwave Remote Sensing on page 136 (equation 6.40).\n\nNow let‚Äôs implement the conversion in Python.\n\ndef lin2db(val: float | int) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts value from linear to dB units.\n\n    :param val: Value in linear units.\n    :type val: float|int\n    :return: Value in dB.\n    :rtype: float\n    \"\"\"\n    return 10 * np.log10(val)\n\n\ndef db2lin(val: float | int) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts value from dB to linear units.\n\n    :param val: Value in dB.\n    :type val: float|int\n    :return: Value in linear units.\n    :rtype: float\n    \"\"\"\n    return 10 ** (val / 10)\n\nWhen performing mathematical operations with SAR data it is important to be aware, that adding values in the logarithmic scale doesn‚Äôt work in the same way as adding regular (linear) values. This is because in the logarithmic scale, each unit step represents an equal multiplication. This means that an addition of two values in the logarithmic scale equals a multiplication of the values in the linear scale. Vice versa, a subtraction in a logarithmic scale equals a division in a linear scale. Let‚Äôs have a look at an example, where we add two values, once without the conversion to linear scale and once with the conversion to linear scale.\n\n# Logarithmic addition\n# Values in linear and decibel units\nval1_db, val2_db = 10, 12\n\n# Logarithmic addition\nsum_db = val1_db + val2_db\nprint(\"Logarithmic Addition:\")\nprint(f\"Logarithmic values: \\t{val1_db: <5}, {val2_db: <5} [dB]\")\nprint(f\"Logarithmic sum: \\t{val1_db} + {val2_db} = {sum_db: <5} [dB]\")\n\n# Linear addition\nval1_lin, val2_lin = db2lin(val1_db), db2lin(val2_db)\nsum_lin = val1_lin + val2_lin\nprint(\"\\nLinear Addition:\")\nprint(\n    f\"\"\"Linear values: \\t\\t{val1_lin: <5}, {val2_lin: <5.2f} [lin]\n      \\t\\t\\t(converted from dB)\"\"\"\n)\nprint(f\"Linear sum: \\t\\t{val1_lin} + {val2_lin: .2f} = {sum_lin: .2f} [lin]\")\nprint(f\"\\t\\t\\t= {lin2db(sum_lin): .2f} [dB]\")\n\nAs you can see, the values in dB and in linear scale differ quite a bit. In the example above, the values differ by a factor of around 6 when looked at in linear scale.\n\nNow that we have some data, we will have a look at some practical examples where we will convert the data to linear scale.\nWhen we try to calculate the average \\sigma^0 value across the scene, we need to do this by converting the data to linear scale first and then calculating the average and converting it back to dB.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-1#conversion-formulas","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Unit Conversion","lvl2":"Creating a Monthly Mosaic"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-1#creating-a-monthly-mosaic","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Unit Conversion","lvl2":"Creating a Monthly Mosaic"},"content":"So in the beginning we have lazily loaded data for an area across a whole year.

Since the data is in dB we need to convert it to linear scale first, then we can resample the data and convert it back to dB.\n\n# Convert to linear scale and calculate monthly means\n# Conversion by calculating with the xarray Object\nsig0_lin = 10 ** (sig0_dc / 10)\n\n# Resample to monthly means.

This makes mountains appear to lean towards the radar system as visible in the below plot of the GRD scene. This latter distortion originates from the side-looking geometry of the SAR system. Due to this, the radar pulse reaches mountain slope facing the sensor before it reaches the base. Consequently, these slopes appear compressed and leaning toward the sensor. During processing to a level 1C product, these slant range distortions are partly corrected using a terrain correction algorithm and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The most common algorithm for this is the Range Doppler Terrain Correction.\n\nFigure 1: Geometric terrain correction. The lower bar shows the GRD without geometric terrain correction  in slant geometry. In areas where the ground is elevated, the time of the signal to travel to the earth‚Äôs surface and back to the sensor is distorted, causing geometric shifts (foreshortening, lengthening, etc). Using a DEM and the Range Doppler Terrain Correction, the distortions are corrected and the image is orthorectified. (Source: ESRI)\n\nLet‚Äôs visualize this geometric terrain correction (GTC) with some actual data using the xarray method hvplot of the gtc_dc object.\n\ngtc_dc.hvplot.image(\n    x=\"x\",\n    y=\"y\",\n    robust=True,\n    data_aspect=1,\n    cmap=\"Greys_r\",\n    groupby=\"band\",\n    rasterize=True,\n).opts(frame_height=600, framewise=False, aspect=\"equal\")\n\nFigure 2: The ground range detected values and geometrically terrain corrected values can be selected on the right-hand side of the graphic.\n\nThe geometrically terrain corrected values from the gtc_dc object (Figure 1) can be approximated to a certain extent, as we have sufficiently detailed information of topography in this area. This corrects for at least one typically occurring distortion in mountainous regions: ‚Äúforeshortening‚Äù.\n\nFigure 3: Side Looking radar distortions (script Chapter 4).\n\nForeshortening can be spotted by eye, as it often has a radiometric consequence, where unusually bright areas fringe mountain ridges; a phenomenon called ‚Äúhighlighting‚Äù. This geometric artifact occurs due to the compression of the distance in the image of slopes facing the radar system and the consequentially higher density of scatterers per unit length. Now let‚Äôs zoom in on an example from the same datacube and display the original and corrected values side-by-side.\n\nfor_dc = gtc_dc.sel(x=slice(9.651, 9.706), y=slice(47.134, 47.079)).band_data\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(20, 8))\n\nbbox = dict(boxstyle=\"round\", fc=\"0.8\")\n\n\nax[1].annotate(\n    \"foreshortening/layover\",\n    xy=(9.674, 47.092),\n    xytext=(0.574, 0.192),\n    textcoords=\"subfigure fraction\",\n    bbox=bbox,\n    arrowprops=dict(facecolor=\"red\", shrink=0.05),\n)\nax[1].annotate(\n    \"radar shadows\",\n    xy=(9.68, 47.119),\n    xytext=(0.6, 0.625),\n    textcoords=\"subfigure fraction\",\n    bbox=bbox,\n    arrowprops=dict(facecolor=\"red\", shrink=0.05),\n)\n\nax[0].axes.set_aspect(\"equal\")\nax[1].axes.set_aspect(\"equal\")\n\nfor_dc.sel(band=\"grd\").plot(ax=ax[0], robust=True, cmap=\"Greys_r\")\nfor_dc.sel(band=\"sig0_gtc\").plot(ax=ax[1], robust=True, cmap=\"Greys_r\")\n\nFigure 4: Close-up inspection of geometric distortions in side-looking radar\n\nAs we can see, not all the geometric distortions can be corrected by the algorithm. Some of the pixels at the mountain ranges appear stretched, as in these areas not enough valid measurements are available. Moreover, we can see dark areas which are indicating radar shadows. These are image areas that could not be captured by the radar sensor and have values close to the noise floor of the Sensor (minimum detectable signal strength) ~ -28dB. It is important to note, that radar shadows are not the same for every image, as they depend on the acquisition geometry, in particular, the incidence angle and the flight direction of the satellite.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-2#geometric-terrain-correction","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Backscattering Coefficients","lvl3":"Backscattering Coefficients"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-2#backscattering-coefficients","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Backscattering Coefficients","lvl3":"Backscattering Coefficients"},"content":"In this chapter, we will look at some of the different backscatter coefficients in more detail (\\sigma^0_E or \\gamma^0_E), where both coefficients are geometrically terrain corrected.

This is because the only difference between \\sigma^0_E and \\gamma^0_E is the change of the reference area. While \\sigma^0_E is defined to be ground range, \\gamma^0_E is defined to be in the plane perpendicular to the line of sight from the sensor.

This correction is necessary, because for slopes facing towards the sensor, a larger ground area contributes to the backscatter value of a slant range resolution cell, than for slopes lying in the opposite direction. This results in significant brightness changes, where foreshortening areas appear brighter and lengthening areas darker. \\gamma^0_T adjusts the backscatter to represent what it would be if the terrain was flat, thus reducing these effects. This significantly reduces the impact of the terrain on the backscatter values, allowing for more accurate comparisons across different terrain types and locations. The correction is done by using a DEM to determine the local illuminated area at each radar position. The above illustrated approach is also referred to as terrain flattening because in the resulting image, mountains appear flat. As \\gamma^0_T is corrected for geometric and radiometric distortions, it is also referred to as Normalized Radar Backscatter (NRB) and is the current standard for Analysis-Ready-Backscatter (ARD).","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-2#radiometric-terrain-correction","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Datacubes"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-3","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Datacubes"},"content":"In this notebook we discuss how we can easily compare images of two or more different time slices, satellites or other earth observation products.

Remember that we deal with a spatiotemporal datacube. This gives us the possibility to study changes for each time increment.

We can achieve this by filtering the datacube with the where method for areas marked with low and high mean LAI values.

Hence we might deduce that we deal with deciduous forest that becomes less green during autumn, as can be expected for the study area.\n\nRemember that longer wavelengths like L-bands are more likely to penetrate through a forest canopy and would interact more readily with larger object like tree trunks and the forest floor. In turn, C-band microwaves are more likely to interact with sparse and shrub vegetation. The polarization of the emitted and received microwaves is on the other hand dependent on the type of backscattering with co-polarization (HH and VV) happening more frequently with direct backscatter or double bounce scattering. Whereas volume scattering occurs when the radar signal is subject to multiple reflections within 3-dimensional matter, as the orientation of the main scatterers is random, the polarization of the backscattered signal is also random. Volume scattering can therefore cause an increase of cross-polarized intensity.\n\nLet‚Äôs put this to the test by checking the microwave backscatter signatures over forested and sparsely vegetated areas as well as water bodies (Lake Garda). Let‚Äôs first look at the different sensor readings for the beginning of summer and autumn.\n\nhv.output(widget_location=\"bottom\")\n\nt1 = (\n    fused_ds.gam0.isel(time=2)\n    .hvplot.image(\n        robust=True, data_aspect=1, cmap=\"Greys_r\", rasterize=True, clim=(-25, 0)\n    )\n    .opts(frame_height=400, aspect=\"equal\")\n)\n\nt2 = (\n    fused_ds.gam0.isel(time=-1)\n    .hvplot.image(\n        robust=True, data_aspect=1, cmap=\"Greys_r\", rasterize=True, clim=(-25, 0)\n    )\n    .opts(frame_height=400, aspect=\"equal\")\n)\n\nt1 + t2\n\nFigure 3: Maps of Sentinel-1 and Alos-2 \\gamma^0_T \\,[dB] for the beginning of summer (left) and autumn (right).\n\nThe most notable difference is the lower energy received for cross-polarized than for co-polarized microwaves for both Sentinel-1 and Alos-2. The latter differences are independent of the time of year. However, one can also note small changes in the received energy for the same satellite dependent on the time of year.

A measurement of 10 dB is 10 times brighter than the intensity measured at 0 dB, and 100 times brighter at 20 dB. The most notable difference is that the offset between cross- and co-polarised signals becomes larger at low LAI and lower at higher LAI. This might indicate the effect of volume scattering in forested areas where co- and cross-polarization render backscattering values more equal.

Many subpixel contributors build up a complex scattered pattern in any SAR image, making it erroneous to rely on a single pixel intensity for making reliable image analysis. In order to enhance the degree of usability of a SAR image, several techniques have been put in place to mitigate speckle.\nWe will now show two of the most common approaches: the temporal and the spatial filter.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-6","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Speckle Statistics","lvl2":"Lake Neusiedl data"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-6#lake-neusiedl-data","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Speckle Statistics","lvl2":"Lake Neusiedl data"},"content":"We load a dataset that contains the CORINE land cover and Sentinel-1 \\sigma^0_E at a 20 meter resolution.

Even though speckle is known for following non-normal distributions (i.e., Rayleigh distribution for amplitude in the linear domain, and the Gumple for intensity in the log domain), we can assume that due to the Central Limit Theorem, the overall backscatter means (dB) tend to follow a Gaussian distribution.\n\nWe can mitigate speckle (it is impossible to remove it completely) by following approaches such as:\n\nspatial filtering - taking mean backscatter value over the same land cover, or\n\ntemporal filtering - taking the average backscatter value over some time period.\n\nEither way, one pixel is never representative of ground truth!

But what is coherence? It is a measure of phase correlation between the master and slave image.\nInterferometric coherence (Œ≥) can be expressed as:Œ≥ = Œ≥_{proc}*Œ≥_{geom}*Œ≥_{vol}*Œ≥_{SNR}*Œ≥_{temp}\n\nwhere Œ≥_{proc} refers to inaccuracies in the processing (e.g., coregistration errors), Œ≥_{geom} refers to the baseline decorrelation (different position of satellites during the two acquisitions), Œ≥_{vol} refers to volume decorrelation (vegetation related), Œ≥_{SNR} refers to the radar instrument thermal noise and Œ≥_{temp} refers to the decorrelation caused by change of position of the objects in the scene during the time interval of the images acquisitions (e.g., plant growth, wind-induced movements or ground deformation due to earthquakes, landslides).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that interferometric accuracy is sensitive to many processes, hence isolating the ground deformation signal involves several operations. On the other hand, interferometric coherence sensitivity could be exploited to track and map phenomena that cause its degradation (e.g., vegetation features, and water content).\n\ninterferogram_ds = cat.inter.read()\n\ncmap_hls_hex = sns.color_palette(\"hls\", n_colors=256).as_hex()\n\ninterferogram_ds = interferogram_ds.where(interferogram_ds != 0)\nigf_da = interferogram_ds.sel(band=1).band_data\ncoh_da = interferogram_ds.sel(band=2).band_data\n\n# Invert y axis\nigf_da[\"y\"] = igf_da.y[::-1]\ncoh_da[\"y\"] = coh_da.y[::-1]\n\nigf_plot = igf_da.hvplot.image(\n    x=\"x\",\n    y=\"y\",\n    cmap=cmap_hls_hex,\n    width=600,\n    height=600,\n    dynamic=False,\n)\n\ncoh_plot = coh_da.hvplot.image(\n    x=\"x\",\n    y=\"y\",\n    cmap=\"viridis\",\n    width=600,\n    height=600,\n    dynamic=False,\n).opts(clim=(0, 1))\n\n(igf_plot + coh_plot).opts(shared_axes=True)\n\nNow we can observe patterns that emerged between the two acquisitions. If you look at the data range in the interferogram (left plot), you‚Äôll notice it spans approximately one wavelength, from -\\pi to œÄ. On the right, you find a plot of the interferometric coherence (values ranging between 0 and 1), where low coherence is found along the ground surface ruptures caused by the earthquake.\nPlease note, that the interferogram has already undergone a deburst operation (all bursts merged into a single image).","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-7#interferogram-formation-and-coherence-estimation","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Interferograms","lvl2":"Topographic Phase Removal"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-7#topographic-phase-removal","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Interferograms","lvl2":"Topographic Phase Removal"},"content":"Since the local topography is an additional phase term constituting the interferogram that we built up so far, we need to make an estimate of its impact in order to further remove it to keep only the ground deformation-related phase.

Coherence is involved in this operation to flag and set areas to no data that are considered unreliable (low coherence) and to keep the reliable ones (high coherence).\n\nFinally, to make data interpretable, we geocode the wrapped interferogram.

Along the earthquake fault line, low coherence between the two phase acquisitions is visible. This occurs due to extreme changes in terrain heights or displacements, which are beyond the sensitivity of the SAR sensor. This area of low coherence indicates higher uncertainty in the interferogram. However, this isn‚Äôt necessarily a drawback, as it helps to clearly identify the earthquake epicenter.\n\nYou can also explore and zoom into regions with ‚Äúfringe patterns‚Äù to observe ground movement. Each fringe cycle (e.g., from red to red or blue to blue) corresponds to ground motion in this case. The fringe patterns indicate motion in the line-of-sight (LOS) of the satellite (Sentinel-1 has a mean incidence angle of 38¬∞) in terms of either uplift (relative motion of the ground towards the satellite) or sinking (relative motion of the ground away from the satellite).\nIf the interferogram phase changes from 0 to -3.14 (cycles in the negative direction), the surface is moving away from the satellite (i.e., sinking movement). Vice versa, if cycles go in the positive direction (from 0 to +3.14), it would mean a relative uplifting movement of the ground.\nIn areas with no ground motion, fringe patterns disappear.\nThe radar‚Äôs sensitivity to motion depends on its wavelength. For Sentinel-1 (~5.6cm), a full fringe cycle (2\\pi) represents a displacement of ~2.8 cm in the LOS direction.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-7#multi-looking-goldstein-phase-filtering-and-geocoding","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Interferograms","lvl2":"Visualisation of the Earthquake Event on July 5th, 2019"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-7#visualisation-of-the-earthquake-event-on-july-5th-2019","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Interferograms","lvl2":"Visualisation of the Earthquake Event on July 5th, 2019"},"content":"\n\nstep = 4  # Downsample data for visualization\nigf_data_subset = igf_data.isel(x=slice(0, -1, step), y=slice(0, -1, step))\n\n\ndef array_to_img(data_array, cmap):\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6), dpi=600)\n    data_array.plot(ax=ax, cmap=cmap, add_colorbar=False, add_labels=False)\n    ax.set_axis_off()\n    buf = BytesIO()\n    plt.savefig(buf, format=\"png\", bbox_inches=\"tight\", pad_inches=0, transparent=True)\n    plt.close(fig)\n    return base64.b64encode(buf.getvalue()).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\n\nigf_image = array_to_img(igf_data_subset, cmap=cmap_hls)\nbounds = [\n    [float(igf_data[\"y\"].min()), float(igf_data[\"x\"].min())],\n    [float(igf_data[\"y\"].max()), float(igf_data[\"x\"].max())],\n]\n\nm = folium.Map(\n    location=[float(igf_data[\"y\"].mean()), float(igf_data[\"x\"].mean())],\n    zoom_start=10,\n)\nfolium.TileLayer(\n    tiles=(\n        \"https://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/\"\n        + \"services/World_Imagery/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}\"\n    ),\n    attr=\"Tiles ¬© Esri\",\n    name=\"ESRI World Imagery\",\n).add_to(m)\nfolium.TileLayer(\n    tiles=(\n        \"https://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/\"\n        + \"services/Reference/World_Boundaries_and_Places/\"\n        + \"MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}\"\n    ),\n    attr=\"Tiles ¬© Esri\",\n    name=\"ESRI Labels\",\n    overlay=True,\n).add_to(m)\n\nfolium.raster_layers.ImageOverlay(\n    image=f\"data:image/png;base64,{igf_image}\",\n    bounds=bounds,\n    opacity=0.65,\n    name=\"Interferogram\",\n).add_to(m)\nfolium.LayerControl().add_to(m)\n\nm","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-7#visualisation-of-the-earthquake-event-on-july-5th-2019","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Phase Unwrapping"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-8","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Phase Unwrapping"},"content":"The goal of this notebook is to read an interferogram image (i.e., 2-D array of phase values) and unwrap it.

The phase difference is usually wrapped within a range of 0 to 2œÄ, because the phase is inherently cyclical. When the true phase difference exceeds 2œÄ, it gets ‚Äúwrapped‚Äù into this range, creating a discontinuous phase signal. Phase unwrapping refers to the process of reconstructing the continuous phase field from the wrapped phase data.\n\nUnwrapping an interferogram is essential for extracting correct information contained in the phase such as surface topography and earth surface deformations.\n\nThere are many approaches that tried to solve the unwrapping problem, tackling challenging scenarios involving noise or large phase discontinuities.

This would result in an unwrapping process that is likely more stable, with reduced noise (invalid phase information in the proximity of the earthquake faults is discarded). However, an excessive coherence threshold might have significant gaps or missing information, especially in areas where motion or surface changes have occurred.\nThe choice of a coherence threshold depends on the balance you want to strike between the accuracy and coverage of the output unwrapped image.\n\nKeep in mind that in case of large displacements, such as the Ridgecrest earthquake, phase unwrapping can be problematic and lead to poor results: when the displacement is large, the phase difference becomes wrapped multiple times, leading to phase aliasing. In this case, the phase values become ambiguous, we cannot distinguish between multiple phase wraps, thus leading to incorrect results.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-8#unwrapping-with-coherence-mask","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Phase Unwrapping","lvl2":"Applying an Equation for the Displacement Map"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-8#applying-an-equation-for-the-displacement-map","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Phase Unwrapping","lvl2":"Applying an Equation for the Displacement Map"},"content":"From the unwrapped phase image (we will use the phase masked with a coherence threshold of 0.3) we can calculate the displacement map using the following equation:\n\n\nd = - \\frac{\\lambda}{4 \\cdot \\pi} \\cdot \\Delta \\phi_d\n\nwhere:\n\n\\lambda = 0.056 for Sentinel-1\n\n\\Delta \\phi_d is the unwrapped image\n\nThis operation can be very useful for monitoring ground deformation.\n\ndef displacement(unw, lambda_val: float = 0.056) -> xr.DataArray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the displacement from the unwrapped phase\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n\n    unw: xarray DataArray with the unwrapped phase\n    unw: xr.DataArray\n    lambda_val: Wavelength of the radar signal\n    lambda_val: float\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    xarray DataArray with the displacement\n    \"\"\"\n    disp = unw * -lambda_val / (4 * np.pi)\n    return disp\n\n\n# Calculate the displacement\ndisp_subset = displacement(subset.unwrapped_coh)\n\n# Plot the displacement map\n(\n    disp_subset.plot.imshow(\n        cmap=cmap_disp, cbar_kwargs={\"label\": \"Meters [m]\"}\n    ).axes.set_title(\"Displacement Map of the Subset\")\n)\nplt.show()\n\n","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-8#applying-an-equation-for-the-displacement-map","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Phase Unwrapping","lvl2":"Coarsen Approach"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-8#coarsen-approach","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Phase Unwrapping","lvl2":"Coarsen Approach"},"content":"As the whole data is too large and the processing time already exceeds 20 minutes when using an image with 4000x4000 pixels, we can coarsen the image so that we can unwrap and compute the displacement for the whole scene.\n\nkernel_size = 3\nlowres = ds.coarsen(x=kernel_size, y=kernel_size, boundary=\"trim\").median()\n\nlowres = unwrap_array(\n    lowres,\n    ntiles=(20, 30),\n    tile_overlap=10,\n    coherence=lowres.coh,\n    coh_low_threshold=0.3,\n    complex_var=\"cmplx\",\n    ouput_var=\"unwrapped\",\n)\n\nWe can now plot the unwrapped image of the low resolution image.\n\n# Plot the unwrapped phase\n(\n    lowres.unwrapped.plot.imshow(cmap=cmap_cyc).axes.set_title(\n        \"Unwrapped Phase entire scene (coarsened)\"\n    )\n)\nplt.show()\n\nWe can also now calculate the displacement map and compare them.\n\nlowres_disp = displacement(lowres.unwrapped)\n\n# Plot the displacement map\n(\n    lowres_disp.plot.imshow(\n        cmap=cmap_disp, cbar_kwargs={\"label\": \"Meters [m]\"}\n    ).axes.set_title(\"Displacement Map entire scene (coarse resolution)\")\n)\nplt.show()\n\nPlot a summary of the previous plots:\n\n# Plot summary of previous plots\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 10))\nax = axs.ravel()\n\n(\n    subset.unwrapped_coh.plot.imshow(\n        cmap=cmap_cyc, ax=ax[0], vmin=-80, vmax=80\n    ).axes.set_title(\"Unwrapped Phase of the subset with Coherence Threshold 0.3\")\n)\n\n(\n    disp_subset.plot.imshow(\n        cmap=cmap_disp, ax=ax[1], cbar_kwargs={\"label\": \"Meters [m]\"}\n    ).axes.set_title(\"Displacement Map of the Subset\")\n)\n\n(\n    lowres.unwrapped.plot.imshow(cmap=cmap_cyc, ax=ax[2]).axes.set_title(\n        \"Unwrapped Phase of the entire scene with Coherence Threshold 0.3 (coarsened)\"\n    )\n)\n\n(\n    lowres_disp.plot.imshow(\n        cmap=cmap_disp, ax=ax[3], cbar_kwargs={\"label\": \"Meters [m]\"}\n    ).axes.set_title(\"Displacement Map entire scene (coarse resolution)\")\n)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\nIn the following animation, we can capture the 3D displacement caused by the Ridgecrest quake by observing the after and before elevation model.\n\n\nCredits: NASA","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/in-class-exercise-8#coarsen-approach","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"How to Cite This Cookbook"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/notebooks/how-to-cite","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"How to Cite This Cookbook"},"content":"The material in this Project Pythia Cookbook is licensed for free and open consumption and reuse.
