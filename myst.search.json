The longevity of the ASCAT microwave backscatter record is therefore well-suited to track climate change, such as soil moisture drying trends and droughts over Mozambique. The surface soil moisture (SSM) retrieved from the product showcased here is available at a sampling distance of 6.25\\,km, this means that one value of soil moisture is available for every 50\\,km^2 (5000\\,ha).\n\nMore information about microwave backscattering and the fundamentals of surface soil moisture retrieval from microwave backscatter signatures can be found in this video:\n\n","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/environmental-remote-sensing/unit-01/handout-drought#overview","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Remotely Sensed Droughts in Mozambique","lvl2":"Imports"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/environmental-remote-sensing/unit-01/handout-drought#imports","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Remotely Sensed Droughts in Mozambique","lvl2":"Imports"},"content":"European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites\n\nimport cartopy.crs as ccrs\nimport holoviews as hv\nimport hvplot.pandas  # noqa\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom bokeh.models import FixedTicker\nfrom envrs.download_path import make_url\nfrom envrs.ssm_cmap import SSM_CMAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/environmental-remote-sensing/unit-01/handout-drought#imports","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Remotely Sensed Droughts in Mozambique","lvl2":"Plotting of Spatial Soil Moisture Maps"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/environmental-remote-sensing/unit-01/handout-drought#plotting-of-spatial-soil-moisture-maps","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Remotely Sensed Droughts in Mozambique","lvl2":"Plotting of Spatial Soil Moisture Maps"},"content":"Let us start by having a look at monthly aggregated SSM derived from ASCAT microwave backscattering over Mozambique. We can easily load the csv-file with pandas from the web, like so:\n\nurl = make_url(\"ascat-6_25_ssm_monthly.csv\")\ndf = pd.read_csv(\n    url,\n    index_col=[\"time\", \"location_id\"],\n    parse_dates=[\"time\"],\n)\n\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data is presented in a long format, where each combination of time and location-id represents a unique observation. The coordinates, latitude (vertical position) and longitude (horizontal position), indicate the location on the Earth’s surface. These geospatial points are one of the simplest types of geospatial data known as the Climate and Forecast (CF) Convention “Point Data”. This format is well-suited for timeseries which is important for detecting droughts.\n\nWe will plot the results using hvplot.points. Hvplot will manage the scattered locations by employing the rasterize parameter, which resamples the data onto a selected grid representation: an Equirectangular projection (a.k.a ‘plate carrée projection’) in this instance. By grouping the data by \"time\", we create an interactive plot that allows us to scroll through all the months from 2007 to the present. Additionally, we will overlay the SSM values onto an Open Street Map (OSM). For convenience, we have included the locations of the in-situ sensors placed in each target district of the DrySAT project.\n\nSSM values are reported as the degree of saturation, indicating how much of the soil pore space is filled with water. This means, values can range from 0%, completely dry soil, to 100%, fully saturated soil. If you would like to obtain absolute values of soil moisture, i.e. how much water is available in the soil in m^3/m^3 you can use the soil porosity of your location and multiply it with the degree of saturation. This is further explained in the following notebook.\n\nThe Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions are standards for\nNetCDF files that define metadata, including variable names, units, and other attributes, to ensure interoperability and consistency in climate and forecast data handling.\n\nlocations = {\n    \"Muanza\": {\"latitude\": -18.9064758, \"longitude\": 34.7738921},\n    \"Chokwé\": {\"latitude\": -24.5894393, \"longitude\": 33.0262595},\n    \"Mabote\": {\"latitude\": -22.0530427, \"longitude\": 34.1227842},\n    \"Mabalane\": {\"latitude\": -23.4258788, \"longitude\": 32.5448211},\n    \"Buzi\": {\"latitude\": -19.9747305, \"longitude\": 34.1391065},\n}\n\ndf_locs = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(locations, \"index\").reset_index()\n\npoints = df_locs.hvplot.points(\n    x=\"longitude\", y=\"latitude\", color=\"black\", crs=ccrs.PlateCarree()\n)\nlabels = df_locs.hvplot.labels(\n    x=\"longitude\",\n    y=\"latitude\",\n    text=\"index\",\n    text_baseline=\"bottom\",\n    text_color=\"black\",\n    crs=ccrs.PlateCarree(),\n)\n\ndf.hvplot.points(\n    x=\"longitude\",\n    y=\"latitude\",\n    c=\"surface_soil_moisture\",\n    groupby=\"time\",\n    x_sampling=0.08,\n    y_sampling=0.08,\n    rasterize=True,\n    crs=ccrs.PlateCarree(),\n    tiles=True,\n    cmap=SSM_CMAP,\n    clim=(0, 100),\n    frame_width=500,\n    clabel=\"Surface soil moisture (%)\",\n) * points * labels\n\n\n\n\n\n","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/environmental-remote-sensing/unit-01/handout-drought#plotting-of-spatial-soil-moisture-maps","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Remotely Sensed Droughts in Mozambique","lvl2":"Plotting of Surface Soil Moisture Timeseries"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/environmental-remote-sensing/unit-01/handout-drought#plotting-of-surface-soil-moisture-timeseries","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Remotely Sensed Droughts in Mozambique","lvl2":"Plotting of Surface Soil Moisture Timeseries"},"content":"Now let us have a closer look at the five locations marked on the SSM map and plot the SSM values against time for these 5 locations—known as timeseries. To do this we have already filtered down the full dataset to only contain the five locations for you. We read these 5 timeseries using pandas and importing the .csv file.  The .csv file contains 5 timeseries of SSM for the locations Buzi, Mabalane, Muanza, Mabote, and Chokwé. This filtered dataset shows the full temporal resolution of the product. To visualize this, we highlight the density of data points falling in a certain sector of the plot with blue shading—bluer values mark a higher density of data points.\n\nts = pd.read_csv(\n    make_url(\"ascat-6_25_ssm_timeseries.csv\"),\n    index_col=\"time\",\n    parse_dates=True,\n)\n\nts.hvplot.scatter(\n    x=\"time\",\n    y=\"surface_soil_moisture\",\n    groupby=\"name\",\n    rasterize=True,\n    dynspread=True,\n    threshold=1,\n    frame_width=800,\n    padding=(0.01, 0.1),\n    clabel=\"Density of data\",\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cyclical seasonal pattern from dry to wet can be easily discerned from the timeseries. Note, however, again that we do not track precipitation, but the change from wet to dry soils. Moreover, we can see that the cyclical pattern breaks down on occasion as can be seen in the years 2015 and 2016. Especially Chokwé displays a complete lack of wet soils during the 2016 rainy season. We can remove some of the noise in the records by aggregating the values on a monthly basis, as can be seen in the following code chunk. Here, the pandas dataframe method groupby can group the timeseries for all successive months with the pandas function Grouper(freq=\"ME\") and the location name. We can then plot the data monthly and color code per location name as follows:\n\nts_monthly = (\n    ts.groupby([pd.Grouper(freq=\"ME\"), \"name\"])\n    .surface_soil_moisture.mean()\n    .reset_index(level=\"name\")\n)\n\nts_monthly.hvplot.line(\n    x=\"time\",\n    y=\"surface_soil_moisture\",\n    by=\"name\",\n    frame_width=800,\n    padding=(0.01, 0.1),\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn these monthly aggregated timeseries we can more easily investigate temporal dynamics per location. Note that we are still looking at the degree of saturation, and that for each location it varies between 0 and 100%. So, these time series do not give us information on the absolute differences in SSM between locations. To do this we would need information on the soil porosity for each site. However, we can use the timeseries at each location to look at temporal dynamics such as changes in the the amplitude, or the magnitude of change in SSM. This is of greater importance for drought detection, as we can see if a change in SSM during a specific time is “normal”, or more “unusual” for this specific location, when compared to other years.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/environmental-remote-sensing/unit-01/handout-drought#plotting-of-surface-soil-moisture-timeseries","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Remotely Sensed Droughts in Mozambique","lvl2":"Normalization and Anomaly Detection"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/environmental-remote-sensing/unit-01/handout-drought#normalization-and-anomaly-detection","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Remotely Sensed Droughts in Mozambique","lvl2":"Normalization and Anomaly Detection"},"content":"To investigate how “unusual” certain periods are, we can calculate Z-score statistics.z_{k,i} = \\frac{\\text{SM}_{k,i} - \\bar{\\text{SM}}_i}{s^{\\bar{\\text{SM}}_i}}\n\nwhere:\\begin{align}\n\\text{SM}_{k,i} &\\quad \\text{:soil moisture for specific period (e.g., month) (} \\; i \\; \\text{) and year (} \\; k \\; \\text{)}\\\\\n\\bar{\\text{SM}}_i &\\quad \\text{: long-term mean soil moisture for specific period (e.g., month) (} \\; i \\; \\text{)} \\\\\ns^{\\bar{\\text{SM}}_i} &\\quad \\text{: long-term standard deviation soil moisture for specific period (e.g., month) (} \\; i \\; \\text{)}\n\\end{align}\n\nThe Z score statistic is an approach to detect anomalies in timeseries, where one measures how far a datapoint (\\text{SM}_{k,i}) is removed from the long-term mean (\\bar{\\text{SM}}).

Correlation analysis is a valuable tool for validating meteorological records by comparing different datasets to ensure consistency and accuracy. It measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. In the context of meteorological records, it helps assess how well different datasets align with each other in terms of temporal dynamics, serving as a quality assurance measure.\n\nBefore applying correlation analysis, we need to reshape our DataFrame by pairing the data to the same timestamps for each of the five locations. For this, we will use the groupby method in combination with the resample method. The resample method will adjust the time index to a new frequency of 1 day, using the median value to down sample the frequencies from 15 minutes to daily for both ASCAT and in-situ sensor data.\n\ndf_insitu_daily = (\n    df_insitu.groupby(\"name\")[\"surface_soil_moisture\"]\n    .resample(\"D\")\n    .median()\n    .to_frame(\"in-situ\")\n)\n\ndf_ascat_vol_daily = (\n    df_ascat_vol.groupby(\"name\")[\"surface_soil_moisture\"]\n    .resample(\"D\")\n    .median()\n    .to_frame(\"ascat\")\n)\n\ndf_resampled = df_ascat_vol_daily.join(df_insitu_daily)\ndf_resampled = df_resampled.dropna()\ndf_resampled.head()\n\n\n\nThe data is now ready for correlation analysis. For time series analysis, if you’re looking at trends and expect a linear relationship, Pearson correlation is straightforward and precise method.r = \\frac{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x}) (y_i - \\bar{y}) }{ \\sqrt{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 } \\sqrt{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2 } }\n\nwhere:\\begin{aligned}\nn &\\quad \\text{: number of data points} \\\\\nx_i  \\; \\text{and} \\; y_i &\\quad \\text{: individual sample points} \\\\\n\\bar{x} &\\quad \\text{: mean of the} \\; x \\; \\text{values} \\\\\n\\bar{y} &\\quad \\text{:  mean of the} \\; y \\;  \\text{values}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1:\n\nr = 1  indicates a perfect positive linear relationship.\n\nr = -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship.\n\nr = 0 indicates no linear relationship.\n\nWe implement this with pandas, as follows:\n\ndf_resampled.groupby(\"name\").corr(method=\"pearson\")\n\n\n\nUse Spearman correlation when the relationship between your time series is not necessarily linear but generally moves in the same direction (monotonic).\\rho = 1 - \\frac{6 \\sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}\n\nwhere:\\begin{aligned}\nn &\\quad \\text{: number of observations} \\\\\nd_i &\\quad \\text{: difference between the ranks of corresponding values} \\; x_i \\; \\text{and} \\;  y_i \n\\end{aligned}\n\nThe interpretation of \\rho is the same as for the Pearson’s correlation (r) coefficient. Spearman is great for data where the ranking of values is important and is less affected by outliers and non-normal distributions. This makes it a robust choice for various types of data. It’s also easy to interpret because it focuses on the overall trend.\n\ndf_resampled.groupby(\"name\").corr(method=\"spearman\")\n\n\n\nThe correlation coefficients for both Pearson and Spearman methods range between 0.6 and 0.8 across different locations, indicating moderate to high positive correlations between the ASCAT HSAF 6.25\\,km data and the in-situ soil moisture estimates.\n\nSo far, we have only evaluated relative temporal trends in the two data sources. However, it is clear from the visual comparison of HSAF ASCAT SSM and in situ soil moisture that there are also absolute differences. To quantify these differences, we will first calculate the bias between in situ and remotely sensed soil moisture. Using Pandas, this involves comparing the mean of the target values (remotely sensed SSM) to the mean of the reference values (in situ SSM). Bias is determined by the difference between these means.\\text{Bias} = \\bar{x}_i - \\bar{y}_i\n\nwhere:\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{y}_i &\\quad \\text{: mean target value (remotely sensed SSM)} \\\\\n\\bar{x}_i &\\quad \\text{: mean reference value (in situ SSM)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nWhich we can easily implement, like so:\n\n(\n    df_resampled.groupby(\"name\")[\"in-situ\"].mean()\n    - df_resampled.groupby(\"name\")[\"ascat\"].mean()\n)\n\n\n\nAbove, we observe the systematic error (in m^3/m^3) for each location. The H SAF ASCAT values are generally lower than the paired in situ observations, with the exception of Chokwé and Buzi. However, these differences are relatively small.\n\nAn interrelated yet distinct statistic is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).\\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - x_i)^2 }\n\nwhere:\\begin{aligned}\nn &\\quad \\text{: number of observations} \\\\\ny_i &\\quad \\text{: target value (remotely sensed SSM)} \\\\\nx_i &\\quad \\text{: reference value (in situ SSM)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nWhereas bias contributes to the overall error measured by RMSE, RMSE captures both the bias and the variance components of the error. The relationship can be expressed through the bias-variance tradeoff:\n\nBias: Reflects the absolute difference among in situ and remotely sensed soil moisture\n\nVariance: Reflects the relative differences among in situ and remotely sensed soil moisture\n\nIrreducible Error: The inherent noise or randomness in the data that cannot be explained\n\nThe total error, as captured by RMSE, can be broken down as:\\text{Total Error (RMSE)} = \\text{Bias}^2+\\text{Variance}+\\text{Irreducible Error}\n\nThis can be implemented, as follows:\n\ndef rmse(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:\n    \"\"\"Root Mean Square Error.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    df: Pandas.DataFrame\n        Target \"ascat\" and reference \"in situ\" columns\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n        Pandas.Series: Root Mean Square Error\n\n    \"\"\"\n    return ((df[\"ascat\"] - df[\"in-situ\"]) ** 2).mean() ** 0.5\n\n\ndf_resampled.groupby(\"name\").apply(rmse)\n\n\n\nHere, we see that the RMSE ranges between 0.06 and 0.08 [m^3 / m^3], which is small compared to the total range of H SAF ASCAT SSM. As a final step, we can visualize the relation of target (remotely sensed SSM) and reference values (in situ soil moisture) using hvplot.\n\nhvplot.scatter_matrix(df_resampled.reset_index(level=0), c=\"name\", alpha=0.3).opts(\n    plot_size=300\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we observe that the relationship between in-situ and remotely sensed values is not entirely linear.

SPEI is seen as the more robust metric for drought monitoring as it uses the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (P – ETo), rather than precipitation (P) as an input alone, and, where the potential evapotranspiration can be calculated from weather data. However, satellite-based soil moisture estimates, and linked drought anomaly indices (e.g., Z scores) might be more suitable for agricultural drought monitoring as they focus more directly on plant water requirements by directly measuring the soil’s available water content.\n\nBoth SPEI and standardized soil moisture drought anomalies, such as Z scores, allow for direct comparisons across different regions and time scales.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nSPEI is a hydro-meteorological indicator for drought monitoring based on anomalies in precipitation and evapotranspiration\n\nZ scores are based on standardized anomalies derived from soil moisture; e.g., spaceborne microwave-retrieved surface soil moisture\n\nThe purpose of this notebook is to compare both drought indicators, particularly focusing on the spatial extent of drought-affected areas.

Precipitation does not account for infiltration and overland flow. In SPEI the type of precipitation is not accounted for, and thus a very intense rainfall event, where a lot of rainfall falls in a short period, will not lead to a sustainable increase in soil water content, and plant available water, as most of the water will not infiltrate in the soil.  Therefore, deviations from the norm are likely more subdued in soil moisture data than in SPEI but are more representative for plant available water and is intricately linked to agricultural practices that are crucial for food security in Mozambique.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/environmental-remote-sensing/unit-01/handout-drought-2#spatial-drought-extent-through-time","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Evaluating the Reliability of Remotely Sensed Droughts","lvl2":"A Comprehensive Comparison of Drought Indicators"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/environmental-remote-sensing/unit-01/handout-drought-2#a-comprehensive-comparison-of-drought-indicators","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Evaluating the Reliability of Remotely Sensed Droughts","lvl2":"A Comprehensive Comparison of Drought Indicators"},"content":"To obtain a more comprehensive and accurate overview of H SAF ASCAT SSM in detecting agriculturally relevant drought events, we will compare it with an additional set of drought indicators.

The NDVI data is sourced from the \n\nCopernicus Land Monitoring Service, and the CHIRPS data is obtained from \n\nClimateSERV. NDVI values range from 0 to 1 and are often classified as follows:\n\n0 to 0.1: Bare soil, rock, or sand.\n\n0.1 to 0.2: Low vegetation or senescent (dying) vegetation.\n\n0.2 to 0.5: Sparse vegetation, such as shrubs and grasslands.\n\n0.5 to 0.7: Moderate to high vegetation, such as crops and forests.\n\n0.7 to 1: High density of green leaves, indicative of very healthy vegetation.\n\nFor this analysis, the ASCAT H SAF surface soil moisture (SSM) data, originally at a 6.25 km resolution and expressed as a percentage of saturation, is converted to a unit scale ranging from 0 to 1.

Linear regression, specifically Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, is a powerful tool for explanatory data analysis. OLS is a good starting point for your analysis as it is easy to interpret; the coefficients directly relate changes in the response variable to one-unit changes in the predictor variables, with the sign and magnitude reflecting the model’s effects. In an OLS regression, these effects refer to the impact of the independent variables on the dependent variable.\n\nAlthough the assumptions underlying OLS regression (such as linearity, independence of observations, and normality of residuals) are likely to be violated, especially in time series analysis where observations closely spaced in time are likely to be dependent on each other (autocorrelation), we can still use OLS for an ad hoc analysis of the previously observed physical relationships. Specifically, we aim to test the following relationships:\n\nMore rain leads to healthier vegetation.\n\nWetter soils lead to healthier vegetation.\n\nThese relationships are intuitively important causal factors. To determine which best explains the dependent variable (NDVI), we will perform OLS regression using the statsmodels package. Note that other Python packages, like scipy.stats, are also available.\n\nWe’ll utilize statsmodels’ formula interface, which allows specifying models with formula strings and directly using pandas.DataFrames. This interface employs a tilde (~) to separate the dependent variable from the independent variables. Interactions between variables can be specified using the * or : operators, enabling easy expansion to multiple regression. It also simplifies variable transformations and polynomial terms.\n\nTo translate the equation:\\text{NDVI} = \\alpha + \\beta \\text{CHIRPS} + \\epsilon\n\ninto an statsmodels formula, you use:\n\ndf_buzi = df_dekadel[df_dekadel.name == \"Buzi\"]\nmod_precip = smf.ols(formula=\"ndvi ~ precip\", data=df_buzi)\n\n\n\nIn this context, ndvi is the dependent variable, precip is the independent variable, and df_buzi is the data frame containing your data. We will focus on the Buzi region for the OLS regression and subsequent analysis.\n\nTo fit the model, simply call the fit method on the generated object. We will then print the parameters and their estimated coefficients as well as the variation in NDVI explained by the R^2 value.\n\nres_precip = mod_precip.fit()\n\nprint(\"Parameters: \\n\", res_precip.params, sep=\"\")\nprint(\"R2: \", res_precip.rsquared)\n\n\n\nWe can see that the model fit with CHIRPS precipitation as independent variable is limited. Now let’s do the same for the second predefined relationship, where we translate (\\text{NDVI} = \\alpha + \\beta \\text{SSM} + \\epsilon) into an statsmodels formula and asses it’s fit, like so:\n\nmod_ssm = smf.ols(formula=\"ndvi ~ surface_soil_moisture\", data=df_buzi)\nres_ssm = mod_ssm.fit()\n\nprint(\"Parameters: \\n\", res_ssm.params, sep=\"\")\nprint(\"R2: \", res_ssm.rsquared)\n\n\n\nThis approach provides better results, explaining nearly 50% of the variance in NDVI with H SAF ASCAT SSM. Additionally, we can visualize these results using an R^2 plot to perform a more detailed diagnostic analysis of the model’s performance. We have predefined and loaded this function at the top of the notebook for clarity.\n\nresults = {\"precip\": res_precip, \"surface_soil_moisture\": res_ssm}\nplot_predicted_values(\n    df_buzi,\n    results,\n    figsize=(10, 5),\n)\n\n\n\n","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/environmental-remote-sensing/unit-01/handout-drought-3#exploration-with-linear-regression","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Leads and lags in Drought Dynamics","lvl2":"Leads and Lags of Water Availability and Vegetation"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/environmental-remote-sensing/unit-01/handout-drought-3#leads-and-lags-of-water-availability-and-vegetation","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Leads and lags in Drought Dynamics","lvl2":"Leads and Lags of Water Availability and Vegetation"},"content":"At the beginning of the notebook, we highlighted that droughts are cascading events where a lack of rain leads to reduced soil moisture, which in turn affects plant health. To study the dynamics of these cascading droughts, we should first examine the effects of precipitation and soil moisture on vegetation under normal conditions. We need to consider both the lead and lag of the respective causes and effects in this system. Precipitation leads, soil moisture replenishment lags, and vegetation responds with a delay to rainfall events.\n\nThough the cyclical nature of NDVI, H SAF ASCAT SSM, and CHIRPS precipitation is evident, these cycles correspond to the dry and wet seasons experienced in Mozambique. To quantify the actual periodicity of these seasons, autocorrelation is a useful tool. Autocorrelation in time series refers to the correlation of a time series with a delayed copy of itself, measuring the extent to which a time series value is linearly related to its past and future values. The following animation visually demonstrates how a copy of the time series is shifted alongside itself, illustrating the corresponding correlation, known as autocorrelation. This can be expressed as:r_k = \\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^{N-k}{(x_t-\\bar{x} )(x_{t+k} -\\bar{x})}}{\\sum_{t=1}^N{(x_t-\\bar{x}})}\n\nplot_step_corr(df_buzi, \"ndvi\", length=72)\n\n\n\nAs expected, it takes 18 lags (or 18 dekads, equivalent to approximately half a year) for the signal to become almost entirely anti-correlated. It then takes 36 lags (or 36 dekads, equivalent to approximately 1 year) for the cycle to complete and the signal to become almost perfectly correlated again.  You can perform you own autocorrelation test with statsmodels, like so:\n\nsmt.acf(df_buzi.ndvi, nlags=4)\n\n\n\nSimilarly, we can compare the lagged time series of CHIRPS precipitation with NDVI and the lagged time series of H SAF ASCAT SSM with NDVI. This type of analysis is known as lagged cross-correlation analysis. The following two animations illustrate the cross-correlations of H SAF ASCAT SSM with NDVI and CHIRPS precipitation with NDVI respectively.\n\nplot_step_corr(df_buzi, \"ndvi\", \"precip\", length=72)\n\n\n\nplot_step_corr(df_buzi, \"ndvi\", \"surface_soil_moisture\", length=72)\n\n\n\nWe observe that these wet-dry cycles do not perfectly align among the two variables in our analysis. In both cases, the correlation initially increases with 3 to 6 lags in the time series for CHIRPS precipitation and H SAF SSM, respectively.\n\nNDVI lags CHIRPS precipitation by 6 dekads (or approximately 2 months).\n\nNDVI lags H SAF SSM by 3 dekads (or approximately 1 month).\n\nYou can again perform you own lagged cross-correlation test with statsmodels, like so:\n\nsmt.ccf(df_buzi.ndvi, df_buzi.surface_soil_moisture, nlags=4)  # for example\n\n\n\n","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/environmental-remote-sensing/unit-01/handout-drought-3#leads-and-lags-of-water-availability-and-vegetation","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Leads and lags in Drought Dynamics","lvl2":"Lagged Variable Regression"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/environmental-remote-sensing/unit-01/handout-drought-3#lagged-variable-regression","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Leads and lags in Drought Dynamics","lvl2":"Lagged Variable Regression"},"content":"Now that we’ve determined the appropriate lag, we can revisit the OLS regression.

This approach can provide insights into how past events influence current outcomes, making it a valuable tool for time series analysis. We implement this as follows:\n\nmod_precip_shift = smf.ols(formula=\"ndvi ~ precip\", data=df_buzi_shift)\nres_precip_shift = mod_precip_shift.fit()\n\nprint(\"Parameters: \\n\", res_precip_shift.params, sep=\"\")\nprint(\"R2: \", res_precip_shift.rsquared)\n\n\n\nWe observe that including lagged rainfall data improves the model fits compared to a model without this information. Next, we will apply the same approach to H SAF SSM, now using a time lag of 3 dekads:\n\nmod_ssm_shift = smf.ols(formula=\"ndvi ~ surface_soil_moisture\", data=df_buzi_shift)\nres_ssm_shift = mod_ssm_shift.fit()\n\nprint(\"Parameters: \\n\", res_ssm_shift.params, sep=\"\")\nprint(\"R2: \", res_ssm_shift.rsquared)\n\n\n\nHere again the model fit improves over the model without lagged variables.

However, the precipitation data does not fully conform to the underlying principles of linear regression with OLS. It is quite obvious from this plot that rainfall data contains a lot of zeros. This should be addressed before one can make inferences from the model.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/environmental-remote-sensing/unit-01/handout-drought-3#lagged-variable-regression","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Leads and lags in Drought Dynamics","lvl2":"Enhancing the Robustness of Lagged Variable OLS Analysis"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/environmental-remote-sensing/unit-01/handout-drought-3#enhancing-the-robustness-of-lagged-variable-ols-analysis","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Leads and lags in Drought Dynamics","lvl2":"Enhancing the Robustness of Lagged Variable OLS Analysis"},"content":"To advance the lagged variable analysis with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), we need to consider several methodological enhancements. Here are strategies to take this forward:\n\nBLUE Estimators:\nEnsure your models conform to the properties of BLUE estimators (Bias, Linearity, Uncorrelated errors, and Efficiency). This will provide the most reliable and unbiased estimates for your regression coefficients.\n\nAutocorrelation:\nAutocorrelation can significantly affect the reliability of your model. We’ve already identified strong autocorrelation in the temporal domain using autocorrelation tests. Consider looking into Generalized Least Squares models, which can account for dependency structures in their residuals.\n\nMultiple Independent Variables:\nIncorporate multiple independent variables, including both lagged and unlagged versions. For example, include precipitation, soil moisture, and other relevant factors with appropriate lag structures to capture their delayed effects.\n\nNon-normal Residuals:\nIf your residuals are not normally distributed, it can impact the validity of your hypothesis tests. Techniques such as transforming the dependent variable (e.g., using log or Box-Cox transformations), or using robust regression methods can help address this.\n\nNon-linear Behavior:\nIf you detect non-linear relationships, consider using polynomial regression or non-linear regression models. Interaction terms between your independent variables can also capture non-linear effects within an OLS framework.\n\nModel Diagnostics:\nRegularly perform diagnostic checks on your models. Examine plots of residuals versus fitted values, histograms of residuals, and autocorrelation plots to ensure model assumptions are met and identify areas for improvement.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, you will significantly enhance the robustness of your lagged variable OLS analysis, ensuring it is both methodologically sound and practically useful for understanding and predicting complex dynamic systems. Ultimately, this will help us better comprehend the normal wet/dry dynamics of the system, allowing us to predict the effects of current drought conditions on crops and subsequently help forecast yield.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/environmental-remote-sensing/unit-01/handout-drought-3#enhancing-the-robustness-of-lagged-variable-ols-analysis","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Microwave Remote Sensing"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Microwave Remote Sensing"},"content":"This course at the TU Wien teaches students to read, visualize and analyze\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data.

Besides EODC’s, other catalogues can be found on \n\nSTAC Index, such as United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat imagery, Sentinel Hub, Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem, and so on. Briefly spoken, STAC can be used to search, discover, and access metadata of these datasets with the same code. The EODC Catalogue can be accessed on the web via this \n\nlink as well.\n\nEach STAC catalog, composed by different providers, has many collections. To get all collections of a catalog, we can print all of them and their ids, which are used to fetch them from the catalog.\n\ncollections = eodc_catalog.get_collections()\n\n# length of string of collection.id, for pretty print\nmax_length = max(len(collection.id) for collection in collections)\n\nfor collection in eodc_catalog.get_collections():\n    print(f\"{collection.id.ljust(max_length)}: {collection.title}\")\n\n\n\nTo get a specific collection from the catalog, we can use the client.get_collection() method and provide the collection name. We can then display its description, id, temporal and spatial extent, license, etc. In this notebook, we will work with the Sentinel-1 sigma naught 20m collection.\n\ncolllection_id = \"SENTINEL1_SIG0_20M\"\n\ncollection = eodc_catalog.get_collection(colllection_id)\ncollection\n\n\n\nEach collection has multiple items. An item is one spatio-temporal instance in the collection, for instance a satellite image. If items are needed for a specific timeframe or for a specific region of interest, we can define this as a query.\n\ntime_range = \"2022-10-01/2022-10-07\"  # a closed range\n# time_range = \"2022-01\"  # whole month, same can be done for a year and a day\n# time_range = \"2022-01-01/..\"  # up to the current date, an open range\n# time_range = \"2022-01-01T05:34:46\"  # a specific time instance\n\n\n\nA spatial region of interest can be defined in different ways. One option is to define a simple bounding box:\n\nlatmin, latmax = 46.3, 49.3  # South to North\nlonmin, lonmax = 13.8, 17.8  # West to East\n\nbounding_box = [lonmin, latmin, lonmax, latmax]\n\n\n\nIf the region of interest is not rectangular, we can also define a polygon:\n\n# GEOJSON can be created on geojson.io\n\n# This specific area of interest is a rectangle, but since it is\n# a closed polygon it seems like it has five nodes\n\narea_of_interest = {\n    \"coordinates\": [\n        [\n            [17.710928010825853, 49.257630084442496],\n            [13.881798300915221, 49.257630084442496],\n            [13.881798300915221, 46.34747715326259],\n            [17.710928010825853, 46.34747715326259],\n            [17.710928010825853, 49.257630084442496],\n        ]\n    ],\n    \"type\": \"Polygon\",\n}\n\n\n\nUsing our previously loaded STAC catalog, we can now search for items fullfilling our query. In this example we are using the bounding box. If we want to use an area of interest specified in the geojson format - one has to use the intersects parameter as documented in the comment below.\n\nsearch = eodc_catalog.search(\n    collections=colllection_id,  # can also be a list of several collections\n    bbox=bounding_box,  # search by bounding box\n    # intersects=area_of_interest,  # GeoJSON search\n    datetime=time_range,\n    # max_items=1  # number of max items to load\n)\n\n# If we comment everything besides colllection_id, we will load whole\n# collection for available region and time_range\n\nitems_eodc = search.item_collection()\nprint(f\"On EODC we found {len(items_eodc)} items for the given search query\")\n\n\n\nNow, we can fetch a single item, in this case a Sentinel-1 image, from the query results. A good practice is to always check what metadata the data provider has stored on the item level. This can be done by looking into the item properties.\n\nitem = items_eodc[0]\nitem.properties\n\n\n\nFor now, let’s display only the vertical-vertical (VV) polarized band of the item and some information about the data.\n\nitem.assets[\"VV\"].extra_fields.get(\"raster:bands\")[0]\n\n\n\nIn the EODC STAC catalogue an item can conveniently be displayed using its thumbnail.\n\nitem.assets[\"thumbnail\"].href\n\n\n\nNow we will plot the data on a map using the thumbnail and the python package \n\nfolium. This is an easy way to quickly check how the data found by a search query looks on a map.\n\nmap = folium.Map(\n    location=[(latmin + latmax) / 2, (lonmin + lonmax) / 2],\n    zoom_start=7,\n    zoom_control=False,\n    scrollWheelZoom=False,\n    dragging=False,\n)\n\nfolium.GeoJson(area_of_interest, name=\"Area of Interest\").add_to(map)\n\nfor item in items_eodc:\n    # url leading to display of an item, can also be used as hyperlink\n    image_url = item.assets[\"thumbnail\"].href\n    bounds = item.bbox\n    folium.raster_layers.ImageOverlay(\n        image=image_url,\n        bounds=[[bounds[1], bounds[0]], [bounds[3], bounds[2]]],\n    ).add_to(map)\n\nfolium.LayerControl().add_to(map)\n\nmap\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Map of study area.

This saves memory, but if one would like to do further analysis, the data has to be loaded into memory or downloaded on disk.\n\nIn the following, we will demonstrate this with the library odc-stac. Here we can define what data will loaded as bands; in this case VV sigma naught. Moreover we can resample the data by providing any coordinate reference system (CRS) and resolution as well as a method for resampling of continuos data (e.g. bilinear resampling). In the example below we use the EQUI7 Grid of Europe and a 20 meter sampling. This is the native format of sigma naught stored at EODC, so there will be no actual resampling. Note, also, that resampling is not advisable for this data, as it is provided on a logarithmic scale. More about this in the notebook “Backscattering Coefficients”.\n\nThe chunks argument is an advancement method for performing parallel computations on the data. We will not cover this in further detail.\n\nbands = \"VV\"  # Vertical-vertical polarized\ncrs = \"EPSG:27704\"  # Coordinate Reference System: EQUI7 Grid of Europe\nres = 20  # 20 meter\nchunks = {\"time\": 1, \"latitude\": 1000, \"longitude\": 1000}\nsig0_dc = odc_stac.load(\n    items_eodc,\n    bands=bands,\n    crs=crs,\n    resolution=res,\n    bbox=bounding_box,\n    chunks=chunks,\n    resampling=\"bilinear\",\n)\n\n\n\nLet’s have a look at the VV polarized band of the dataset.\n\nsig0_dc.VV\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the data is stored as a xarray DataArray. Xarray is a convenient package for multidimensional labeled arrays, like temperature, humidity, pressure, different bands of satellite imagery, and so on. \n\nThe link provides detailed documentation. In a later notebook we will explore some more of the functionality of xarray. As we can see in the coordinates, the data here consists of 21 time steps.\n\nIn general, data from STAC is “lazily” loaded, which means that the structure of the DataArray is constructed, but the data is not loaded yet. It is loaded only at instance when it is needed, for example, for plotting, computations, and so on.\n\nSince the DataArray has currently a size of almost 18 GiB, we will subset it to the region of Vienna.\n\n# Create a bounding box covering the region of Vienna\nlatmin_smaller, latmax_smaller = 48, 48.4\nlonmin_smaller, lonmax_smaller = 16, 16.5\n\nsmaller_bounding_box = [\n    [latmin_smaller, lonmin_smaller],\n    [latmax_smaller, lonmax_smaller],\n]\n\nmap = folium.Map(\n    location=[\n        (latmin_smaller + latmax_smaller) / 2,\n        (lonmin_smaller + lonmax_smaller) / 2,\n    ],\n    zoom_start=8,\n    zoom_control=False,\n    scrollWheelZoom=False,\n    dragging=False,\n)\n\nfolium.GeoJson(area_of_interest, name=\"Area of Interest\").add_to(map)\n\nfolium.Rectangle(\n    bounds=smaller_bounding_box,\n    color=\"red\",\n).add_to(map)\n\nfor item in items_eodc:\n    image_url = item.assets[\"thumbnail\"].href\n    bounds = item.bbox\n    folium.raster_layers.ImageOverlay(\n        image=image_url,\n        bounds=[[bounds[1], bounds[0]], [bounds[3], bounds[2]]],\n    ).add_to(map)\n\nfolium.LayerControl().add_to(map)\n\nmap\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Map of study area. Blue rectangle is the area covered by the discovered data. Red rectangle covers the selected data.\n\nCreate a new dataset with the smaller bounding box covering the region of Vienna. We will leave out the arguments for resampling and directly use the native format as defined in the metadata.\n\nsig0_dc = odc_stac.load(\n    items_eodc,\n    bands=bands,\n    bbox=[lonmin_smaller, latmin_smaller, lonmax_smaller, latmax_smaller],\n    chunks=chunks,\n)\n\n\n\nDue to the way the data is acquired and stored, some items include “no data” areas. In our case, no data has the value -9999, but this can vary from data provider to data provider. This information can usually be found in the metadata. Furthermore, to save memory, data is often stored as integer (e.g. 25) and not in float (e.g. 2.5) format. For this reason, the backscatter values are often multiplied by a scale factor, in this case factor 10.\n\nAs Sentinel-1 satellites overpasses Austria every few days, only some time steps of the dataset will have physical data. As a final step, we will now decode the data and create a plot of two consecutive Sentinel-1 acquisitions of Vienna.\n\n# Retrieve the scale factor and NoData value from the metadata. raster:bands is\n# a STAC raster extension\nscale = item.assets[\"VV\"].extra_fields.get(\"raster:bands\")[0][\"scale\"]\nnodata = item.assets[\"VV\"].extra_fields.get(\"raster:bands\")[0][\"nodata\"]\n\n# Decode data with the NoData value and the scale factor\nsig0_dc = sig0_dc.where(sig0_dc != nodata) / scale\n\n# We should remove unnecessary dates when there was no data\n# (no satellite overpass)\nsig0_dc = sig0_dc.dropna(dim=\"time\")\n\n\n\nsig0_dc.VV.plot(col=\"time\", robust=True, cmap=\"Greys_r\", aspect=1, size=10)\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Sentinel-1 microwave backscatter image for two timeslices.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/unit-01/in-class-exercise#data-reading","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Unit Conversion"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/unit-01/in-class-exercise-1","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Unit Conversion"},"content":"In this notebook, we are going to have a look at the conversion of units.

The values in dB are more evenly distributed and are therefore easier to plot. The values in linear scale are more spread out and are therefore harder to interpret.\nThis is why we use the dB scale for plotting/visualization.\n\nWhile the logarithmic scale facilitates visual interpretation, it has implications for mathematical operations. In the following, we’ll have a closer look at this. But first, let’s see how we can convert between the linear and the logarithmic domains.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/unit-01/in-class-exercise-1#comparison-of-the-data-in-db-and-linear-scale","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Unit Conversion","lvl2":"Conversion Formulas"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/unit-01/in-class-exercise-1#conversion-formulas","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Unit Conversion","lvl2":"Conversion Formulas"},"content":"The decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit used to express the ratio of two values of a physical quantity, often power or intensity. In the case of SAR data, the backscatter coefficient is often expressed in dB to facilitate visualization.\n\nIn order to convert the data from dB to linear scale, we use the following formula.\nLet D be the original value (dB) and I the converted value (m^2m^{-2}). The conversion of units can be expressed as:D =  10  \\cdot \\log_{10} (I) = 10 \\cdot \\log_{10} (e) \\cdot \\ln (I)\\longrightarrow [dB]\n\nSimilarly, the conversion back to the original unit can be expressed as:I = e^{\\frac{D}{10\\cdot \\log_{10}(e)}} = 10^{\\frac{D}{10}} \\longrightarrow [m^2m^{-2}]\n\nYou can find these formulas in the script for Microwave Remote Sensing on page 136 (equation 6.40).\n\nNow let’s implement the conversion in Python.\n\ndef lin2db(val: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Converts value from linear to dB units.\n\n    :param val: Value in linear units.\n    :type val: float|int\n    :return: Value in dB.\n    :rtype: float\n    \"\"\"\n    return 10 * np.log10(val)\n\n\ndef db2lin(val: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Converts value from dB to linear units.\n\n    :param val: Value in dB.\n    :type val: float|int\n    :return: Value in linear units.\n    :rtype: float\n    \"\"\"\n    return 10 ** (val / 10)\n\n\n\nWhen performing mathematical operations with SAR data it is important to be aware, that adding values in the logarithmic scale doesn’t work in the same way as adding regular (linear) values. This is because in the logarithmic scale, each unit step represents an equal multiplication. This means that an addition of two values in the logarithmic scale equals a multiplication of the values in the linear scale. Vice versa, a subtraction in a logarithmic scale equals a division in a linear scale. Let’s have a look at an example, where we add two values, once without the conversion to linear scale and once with the conversion to linear scale.\n\n# Logarithmic addition\n# Values in linear and decibel units\nval1_db, val2_db = 10, 12\n\n# Logarithmic addition\nsum_db = val1_db + val2_db\nprint(\"Logarithmic Addition:\")\nprint(f\"Logarithmic values: \\t{val1_db: <5}, {val2_db: <5} [dB]\")\nprint(f\"Logarithmic sum: \\t{val1_db} + {val2_db} = {sum_db: <5} [dB]\")\n\n# Linear addition\nval1_lin, val2_lin = db2lin(val1_db), db2lin(val2_db)\nsum_lin = val1_lin + val2_lin\nprint(\"\\nLinear Addition:\")\nprint(\n    f\"\"\"Linear values: \\t\\t{val1_lin: <5}, {val2_lin: <5.2f} [lin]\n      \\t\\t\\t(converted from dB)\"\"\"\n)\nprint(f\"Linear sum: \\t\\t{val1_lin} + {val2_lin: .2f} = {sum_lin: .2f} [lin]\")\nprint(f\"\\t\\t\\t= {lin2db(sum_lin): .2f} [dB]\")\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the values in dB and in linear scale differ quite a bit. In the example above, the values differ by a factor of around 6 when looked at in linear scale.\n\nNow that we have some data, we will have a look at some practical examples where we will convert the data to linear scale.\nWhen we try to calculate the average \\sigma^0 value across the scene, we need to do this by converting the data to linear scale first and then calculating the average and converting it back to dB.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/unit-01/in-class-exercise-1#conversion-formulas","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Unit Conversion","lvl2":"Creating a Monthly Mosaic"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/unit-01/in-class-exercise-1#creating-a-monthly-mosaic","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Unit Conversion","lvl2":"Creating a Monthly Mosaic"},"content":"So in the beginning we have lazily loaded data for an area across a whole year.

This correction is necessary, because for slopes facing towards the sensor, a larger ground area contributes to the backscatter value of a slant range resolution cell, than for slopes lying in the opposite direction. This results in significant brightness changes, where foreshortening areas appear brighter and lengthening areas darker. \\gamma^0_T adjusts the backscatter to represent what it would be if the terrain was flat, thus reducing these effects. This significantly reduces the impact of the terrain on the backscatter values, allowing for more accurate comparisons across different terrain types and locations. The correction is done by using a DEM to determine the local illuminated area at each radar position. The above illustrated approach is also referred to as terrain flattening because in the resulting image, mountains appear flat. As \\gamma^0_T is corrected for geometric and radiometric distortions, it is also referred to as Normalized Radar Backscatter (NRB) and is the current standard for Analysis-Ready-Backscatter (ARD).","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/unit-01/in-class-exercise-2#radiometric-terrain-correction","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Datacubes"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/unit-02/in-class-exercise","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Datacubes"},"content":"In this notebook we discuss how we can easily compare images of two or more different time slices, satellites or other earth observation products.

The following s1_preprocess function allows to load all files in one go as a spatiotemporal datacube.

Again timeslices are stored separately as individual GeoTIFFS and they need to be concatenated along the time dimension.

Remember that we deal with a spatiotemporal datacube. This gives us the possibility to study changes for each time increment.

Hence we might deduce that we deal with deciduous forest that becomes less green during autumn, as can be expected for the study area.\n\nRemember that longer wavelengths like L-bands are more likely to penetrate through a forest canopy and would interact more readily with larger object like tree trunks and the forest floor. In turn, C-band microwaves are more likely to interact with sparse and shrub vegetation. The polarization of the emitted and received microwaves is on the other hand dependent on the type of backscattering with co-polarization (HH and VV) happening more frequently with direct backscatter or double bounce scattering. Whereas volume scattering occurs when the radar signal is subject to multiple reflections within 3-dimensional matter, as the orientation of the main scatterers is random, the polarization of the backscattered signal is also random. Volume scattering can therefore cause an increase of cross-polarized intensity.\n\nLet’s put this to the test by checking the microwave backscatter signatures over forested and sparsely vegetated areas as well as water bodies (Lake Garda). Let’s first look at the different sensor readings for the beginning of summer and autumn.\n\nhv.output(widget_location=\"bottom\")\n\nt1 = (\n    fused_ds.gam0.isel(time=2)\n    .hvplot.image(\n        robust=True, data_aspect=1, cmap=\"Greys_r\", rasterize=True, clim=(-25, 0)\n    )\n    .opts(frame_height=400, aspect=\"equal\")\n)\n\nt2 = (\n    fused_ds.gam0.isel(time=-1)\n    .hvplot.image(\n        robust=True, data_aspect=1, cmap=\"Greys_r\", rasterize=True, clim=(-25, 0)\n    )\n    .opts(frame_height=400, aspect=\"equal\")\n)\n\nt1 + t2\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Maps of Sentinel-1 and Alos-2 \\gamma^0_T \\,[dB] for the beginning of summer (left) and autumn (right).\n\nThe most notable difference is the lower energy received for cross-polarized than for co-polarized microwaves for both Sentinel-1 and Alos-2. The latter differences are independent of the time of year. However, one can also note small changes in the received energy for the same satellite dependent on the time of year.

A measurement of 10 dB is 10 times brighter than the intensity measured at 0 dB, and 100 times brighter at 20 dB. The most notable difference is that the offset between cross- and co-polarised signals becomes larger at low LAI and lower at higher LAI. This might indicate the effect of volume scattering in forested areas where co- and cross-polarization render backscattering values more equal.

The introduction of a simulated 30% speckle noise could be related to the presence of distributed scatterers of any sort present in the scene, which would cause a pixel-to-pixel variation in terms of intensity.\n\nAll the random contributions (such as the wind) would result in a different speckle pattern each time a SAR scene is acquired over the same area. Many subpixel contributors build up a complex scattered pattern in any SAR image, making it erroneous to rely on a single pixel intensity for making reliable image analysis. In order to enhance the degree of usability of a SAR image, several techniques have been put in place to mitigate speckle.\nWe will now show two of the most common approaches: the temporal and the spatial filter.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/unit-03/in-class-exercise","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Speckle Statistics","lvl2":"Lake Neusiedl data"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/unit-03/in-class-exercise#lake-neusiedl-data","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Speckle Statistics","lvl2":"Lake Neusiedl data"},"content":"We load a dataset that contains the CORINE land cover and Sentinel-1 \\sigma^0_E at a 20 meter resolution.

For example, we need to subtract from the interferogram the flat-earth phase contribution, which is a signal contribution due to the curvature of the Earth’s surface.\nThis is here done automatically through the SNAP software operators.\n\nIn general, the accuracy of interferometric measurements are influenced by many contributors that could result in a loss of coherence. But what is coherence? It is a measure of phase correlation between the master and slave image.\nInterferometric coherence (γ) can be expressed as:γ = γ_{proc}*γ_{geom}*γ_{vol}*γ_{SNR}*γ_{temp}\n\nwhere γ_{proc} refers to inaccuracies in the processing (e.g., coregistration errors), γ_{geom} refers to the baseline decorrelation (different position of satellites during the two acquisitions), γ_{vol} refers to volume decorrelation (vegetation related), γ_{SNR} refers to the radar instrument thermal noise and γ_{temp} refers to the decorrelation caused by change of position of the objects in the scene during the time interval of the images acquisitions (e.g., plant growth, wind-induced movements or ground deformation due to earthquakes, landslides).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that interferometric accuracy is sensitive to many processes, hence isolating the ground deformation signal involves several operations. On the other hand, interferometric coherence sensitivity could be exploited to track and map phenomena that cause its degradation (e.g., vegetation features, and water content).\n\ninterferogram_ds = cat.inter.read()\n\ncmap_hls_hex = sns.color_palette(\"hls\", n_colors=256).as_hex()\n\ninterferogram_ds = interferogram_ds.where(interferogram_ds != 0)\nigf_da = interferogram_ds.sel(band=1).band_data\ncoh_da = interferogram_ds.sel(band=2).band_data\n\n# Invert y axis\nigf_da[\"y\"] = igf_da.y[::-1]\ncoh_da[\"y\"] = coh_da.y[::-1]\n\nigf_plot = igf_da.hvplot.image(\n    x=\"x\",\n    y=\"y\",\n    cmap=cmap_hls_hex,\n    width=600,\n    height=600,\n    dynamic=False,\n)\n\ncoh_plot = coh_da.hvplot.image(\n    x=\"x\",\n    y=\"y\",\n    cmap=\"viridis\",\n    width=600,\n    height=600,\n    dynamic=False,\n).opts(clim=(0, 1))\n\n(igf_plot + coh_plot).opts(shared_axes=True)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can observe patterns that emerged between the two acquisitions.

Coherence is involved in this operation to flag and set areas to no data that are considered unreliable (low coherence) and to keep the reliable ones (high coherence).\n\nFinally, to make data interpretable, we geocode the wrapped interferogram.

Along the earthquake fault line, low coherence between the two phase acquisitions is visible. This occurs due to extreme changes in terrain heights or displacements, which are beyond the sensitivity of the SAR sensor. This area of low coherence indicates higher uncertainty in the interferogram. However, this isn’t necessarily a drawback, as it helps to clearly identify the earthquake epicenter.\n\nYou can also explore and zoom into regions with “fringe patterns” to observe ground movement. Each fringe cycle (e.g., from red to red or blue to blue) corresponds to ground motion in this case. The fringe patterns indicate motion in the line-of-sight (LOS) of the satellite (Sentinel-1 has a mean incidence angle of 38°) in terms of either uplift (relative motion of the ground towards the satellite) or sinking (relative motion of the ground away from the satellite).\nIf the interferogram phase changes from 0 to -3.14 (cycles in the negative direction), the surface is moving away from the satellite (i.e., sinking movement). Vice versa, if cycles go in the positive direction (from 0 to +3.14), it would mean a relative uplifting movement of the ground.\nIn areas with no ground motion, fringe patterns disappear.\nThe radar’s sensitivity to motion depends on its wavelength. For Sentinel-1 (~5.6cm), a full fringe cycle (2\\pi) represents a displacement of ~2.8 cm in the LOS direction.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/unit-03/in-class-exercise-1#multi-looking-goldstein-phase-filtering-and-geocoding","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Interferograms","lvl2":"Visualisation of the Earthquake Event on July 5th, 2019"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/unit-03/in-class-exercise-1#visualisation-of-the-earthquake-event-on-july-5th-2019","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Interferograms","lvl2":"Visualisation of the Earthquake Event on July 5th, 2019"},"content":"\n\nstep = 4  # Downsample data for visualization\nigf_data_subset = igf_data.isel(x=slice(0, -1, step), y=slice(0, -1, step))\n\n\ndef array_to_img(data_array, cmap):\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6), dpi=600)\n    data_array.plot(ax=ax, cmap=cmap, add_colorbar=False, add_labels=False)\n    ax.set_axis_off()\n    buf = BytesIO()\n    plt.savefig(buf, format=\"png\", bbox_inches=\"tight\", pad_inches=0, transparent=True)\n    plt.close(fig)\n    return base64.b64encode(buf.getvalue()).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\n\nigf_image = array_to_img(igf_data_subset, cmap=cmap_hls)\nbounds = [\n    [float(igf_data[\"y\"].min()), float(igf_data[\"x\"].min())],\n    [float(igf_data[\"y\"].max()), float(igf_data[\"x\"].max())],\n]\n\nm = folium.Map(\n    location=[float(igf_data[\"y\"].mean()), float(igf_data[\"x\"].mean())],\n    zoom_start=10,\n)\nfolium.TileLayer(\n    tiles=(\n        \"https://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/\"\n        \"services/World_Imagery/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}\"\n    ),\n    attr=\"Tiles © Esri\",\n    name=\"ESRI World Imagery\",\n).add_to(m)\nfolium.TileLayer(\n    tiles=(\n        \"https://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/\"\n        \"services/Reference/World_Boundaries_and_Places/\"\n        \"MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}\"\n    ),\n    attr=\"Tiles © Esri\",\n    name=\"ESRI Labels\",\n    overlay=True,\n).add_to(m)\n\nfolium.raster_layers.ImageOverlay(\n    image=f\"data:image/png;base64,{igf_image}\",\n    bounds=bounds,\n    opacity=0.65,\n    name=\"Interferogram\",\n).add_to(m)\nfolium.LayerControl().add_to(m)\n\nm\n\n","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/unit-03/in-class-exercise-1#visualisation-of-the-earthquake-event-on-july-5th-2019","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Phase Unwrapping"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/unit-03/in-class-exercise-2","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Phase Unwrapping"},"content":"The goal of this notebook is to read an interferogram image (i.e., 2-D array of phase values) and unwrap it. Phase unwrapping is a critical process in interferometry, which involves recovering unambiguous phase data from the interferogram.\n\nA SAR interferogram represents the phase difference between two radar acquisitions (i.e., two SLC images). The phase difference is usually wrapped within a range of 0 to 2π, because the phase is inherently cyclical. When the true phase difference exceeds 2π, it gets “wrapped” into this range, creating a discontinuous phase signal. Phase unwrapping refers to the process of reconstructing the continuous phase field from the wrapped phase data.\n\nUnwrapping an interferogram is essential for extracting correct information contained in the phase such as surface topography and earth surface deformations.\n\nThere are many approaches that tried to solve the unwrapping problem, tackling challenging scenarios involving noise or large phase discontinuities.

This would result in an unwrapping process that is likely more stable, with reduced noise (invalid phase information in the proximity of the earthquake faults is discarded). However, an excessive coherence threshold might have significant gaps or missing information, especially in areas where motion or surface changes have occurred.\nThe choice of a coherence threshold depends on the balance you want to strike between the accuracy and coverage of the output unwrapped image.\n\nKeep in mind that in case of large displacements, such as the Ridgecrest earthquake, phase unwrapping can be problematic and lead to poor results: when the displacement is large, the phase difference becomes wrapped multiple times, leading to phase aliasing. In this case, the phase values become ambiguous, we cannot distinguish between multiple phase wraps, thus leading to incorrect results.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/unit-03/in-class-exercise-2#unwrapping-with-coherence-mask","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Phase Unwrapping","lvl2":"Applying an Equation for the Displacement Map"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/unit-03/in-class-exercise-2#applying-an-equation-for-the-displacement-map","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Phase Unwrapping","lvl2":"Applying an Equation for the Displacement Map"},"content":"From the unwrapped phase image (we will use the phase masked with a coherence threshold of 0.3) we can calculate the displacement map using the following equation:\n\n\nd = - \\frac{\\lambda}{4 \\cdot \\pi} \\cdot \\Delta \\phi_d\n\nwhere:\n\n\\lambda = 0.056 for Sentinel-1\n\n\\Delta \\phi_d is the unwrapped image\n\nThis operation can be very useful for monitoring ground deformation.\n\ndef displacement(unw, lambda_val: float = 0.056) -> xr.DataArray:\n    \"\"\"Calculates the displacement from the unwrapped phase\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    unw: xarray DataArray with the unwrapped phase\n    unw: xr.DataArray\n    lambda_val: Wavelength of the radar signal\n    lambda_val: float\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    xarray DataArray with the displacement\n\n    \"\"\"\n    disp = unw * -lambda_val / (4 * np.pi)\n    return disp\n\n\n# Calculate the displacement\ndisp_subset = displacement(subset.unwrapped_coh)\n\n\n\n# Plot the displacement map\n(\n    disp_subset.plot.imshow(\n        cmap=cmap_disp, cbar_kwargs={\"label\": \"Meters [m]\"}\n    ).axes.set_title(\"Displacement Map of the Subset\")\n)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/unit-03/in-class-exercise-2#applying-an-equation-for-the-displacement-map","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Phase Unwrapping","lvl2":"Coarsen Approach"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/unit-03/in-class-exercise-2#coarsen-approach","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Phase Unwrapping","lvl2":"Coarsen Approach"},"content":"As the whole data is too large and the processing time already exceeds 20 minutes when using an image with 4000x4000 pixels, we can coarsen the image so that we can unwrap and compute the displacement for the whole scene.\n\nkernel_size = 3\nlowres = ds.coarsen(x=kernel_size, y=kernel_size, boundary=\"trim\").median()\n\n\n\nlowres = unwrap_array(\n    lowres,\n    ntiles=(20, 30),\n    tile_overlap=10,\n    coherence=lowres.coh,\n    coh_low_threshold=0.3,\n    complex_var=\"cmplx\",\n    ouput_var=\"unwrapped\",\n)\n\n\n\nWe can now plot the unwrapped image of the low resolution image.\n\n# Plot the unwrapped phase\n(\n    lowres.unwrapped.plot.imshow(cmap=cmap_cyc).axes.set_title(\n        \"Unwrapped Phase entire scene (coarsened)\"\n    )\n)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nWe can also now calculate the displacement map and compare them.\n\nlowres_disp = displacement(lowres.unwrapped)\n\n# Plot the displacement map\n(\n    lowres_disp.plot.imshow(\n        cmap=cmap_disp, cbar_kwargs={\"label\": \"Meters [m]\"}\n    ).axes.set_title(\"Displacement Map entire scene (coarse resolution)\")\n)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nPlot a summary of the previous plots:\n\n# Plot summary of previous plots\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 10))\nax = axs.ravel()\n\n(\n    subset.unwrapped_coh.plot.imshow(\n        cmap=cmap_cyc, ax=ax[0], vmin=-80, vmax=80\n    ).axes.set_title(\"Unwrapped Phase of the subset with Coherence Threshold 0.3\")\n)\n\n(\n    disp_subset.plot.imshow(\n        cmap=cmap_disp, ax=ax[1], cbar_kwargs={\"label\": \"Meters [m]\"}\n    ).axes.set_title(\"Displacement Map of the Subset\")\n)\n\n(\n    lowres.unwrapped.plot.imshow(cmap=cmap_cyc, ax=ax[2]).axes.set_title(\n        \"Unwrapped Phase of the entire scene with Coherence Threshold 0.3 (coarsened)\"\n    )\n)\n\n(\n    lowres_disp.plot.imshow(\n        cmap=cmap_disp, ax=ax[3], cbar_kwargs={\"label\": \"Meters [m]\"}\n    ).axes.set_title(\"Displacement Map entire scene (coarse resolution)\")\n)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\nIn the following animation, we can capture the 3D displacement caused by the Ridgecrest quake by observing the after and before elevation model.\n\n\nCredits: NASA","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/courses/microwave-remote-sensing/unit-03/in-class-exercise-2#coarsen-approach","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"How to Cite This Cookbook"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/notebooks/how-to-cite","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"How to Cite This Cookbook"},"content":"The material in this Project Pythia Cookbook is licensed for free and open consumption and reuse.

Of course, these are the figures we’ve been trying to find this whole time. We don’t actually have them yet, so what can we do? In Bayesian statistics, we can just start with our best guess. These guesses are called our “priors”, because they are the beliefs we hold prior to looking at the data.
